The first line is the title.

The second line is a CSV list of tags.

The remaining lines are three sections divided by a line starting with  "==".

The first section is the plain text description.

The second section is the plain Go code.

The third section is the reflect code equivalent to that in the second section.

In each of section two and three, anything tab indented code and anything not so
indented is considered explanatory text.

When using methods make sure to include the type of the method, in Type.Method,
somewhere in the text so that the 'by use' contents can be correctly built.
Similiarly when using top level declarations from the reflect package, qualify
with package, such as reflect.Value
