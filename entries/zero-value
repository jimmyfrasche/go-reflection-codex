Zero value
Any kind
==
When not using reflect we generally know the type and hence
the zero value. Of course the simplest means is to declare a variable.
	var v T

==
When you're using reflect and need a type's zero value you need to pass a value of
reflect.Type, say T, to reflect.Zero

	reflect.Zero(T)
