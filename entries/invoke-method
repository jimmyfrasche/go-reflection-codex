Invoke a method
Func,Method
===
	Object.Method()
===
Given an object with a method of a known name, use Value.MethodByName
	obj := reflect.ValueOf(Object)
	obj.MethodByName("Method").Call(nil)

If Method is the 2nd method on obj, this is equivalent:
	obj.Method(1).Call(nil)

Value.Method will panic if there is no nth method, so use Value.NumMethod to
make sure that
	n < obj.NumMethod()

Invoking a method is essentially the same as calling a function. See that section for more information on Value.Call.

The method's receiver will always be the reflect.Value that you called
Method or MethodByName on.
